# VinylCollector


This is an MVC project that utilizes Entity Framework. The purpose is to catalogue my vinyl collection. It supports crud operations, and each artist has a many-to-one relationship with albums, and albums have a many-to-one relationship with tracks.

In version 1.0, I will release an API call either to Discogs or Amazon which will call a live price for each record, if it can be found, or will go to default of last known.
